# ESPN API Endpoints

## Some Notes
- This is for information only and big thanks to ESPN for allowing us access to these API's.  Having the ability to see stats I want specifically while I am watching ESPN is fantastic.
- You will see different apis and endpoints.
- Seasontype also changes for sports, but there is some commonality.  For example:
